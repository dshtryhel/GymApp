Description
==============
This repository contains an iOS application that includes two UIKit views and one SwiftUI view. The project is built using the RxSwift framework, applying the MVVM-ะก (Model-View-ViewModel Coordinator) architectural pattern. Coordinator helps handle navigation logic separately from view controllers and facilitates dependency injection for modular and testable code. Coordinators can be reused for consistent navigation across the app. This choice allows for a reactive and scalable codebase, promoting separation of concerns and maintainability.
